# Random-grades-to-given-students-using-pointers
Write a program that asks the user for the number of students, n, in the class, dynamically allocates enough space in memory for n grades and generates n random grades (using rand()) between 0 and 100 (minimum 0 and maximum 100) which it stores in this space. Display the stored grades.
